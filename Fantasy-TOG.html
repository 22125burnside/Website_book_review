            <h2 class="wordreview">I read this book first in the series which is very controversial but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a great start to the story and very interesting storylines but it could have been a bit more interesting at times. 
                The Assassin and the Pirate Lord was the first novella and was a very gripping and interesting start. It introduces us to Celeana Sardothien who is without a doubt one of my favourite characters ever created.
                The Assassin and the Healer was an amazing story. I loved the character of Yrene and the way that she helped Celeana after she had found herself isolated. My favourite part was Celeana leaving her broach and the note saying “For wherever you go - and then some. The world needs more healers.”
                The Assassin and the Desert was my favourite novella in the book as it was a very engaging story. I never expected Ansel to betray her and it was very sad when she did because I loved her character.
                The Assassin and the Underworld was a very gripping story that had me flipping the pages so fast to figure out what was going to happen next. I love Sam and Celeana and the sewer scene was absolute perfection.
                The Assassin and the Empire was the perfect end to this book. I could not believe that Sam died in such a gruesome and terrible way. Celeana did not deserve that ending to be sent to Endovier. I loved the storyline though and the way they were just about to get their perfect ending. I think this opened up to the next book perfectly.

            <h2 class="wordreview">I loved this book and I thought it was a great book that had the perfect amount of twists and turns. Some names were hard to pronounce and some bits of writing were not the most interesting but overall I really liked this book.
                This book starts off with Celeana Sardothien coming out of Endovier (the salt mines) to participate in a series of challenges to compete for the opportunity of the king's assassin by the crown prince, Dorian's, request.
                She then makes it to the castle under an alias and realises that things are going wrong. The mystery of why the other contestants were dying as well as her relationship with Chaol and Dorian kept me very engaged and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
                I liked Celeana and Nehemia's relationship and I love how Sarah J Mass didn't ruin their friendship at the end of the book like most authors do. I did believe that it was Nehemia pulling the strings behind the murder at the start but then when I found out it was Cain I was a bit mad at the anticlimactic villain choice.
                I absolutely loved the character of Dorian and his relationship with Celeana. The billiard scene, the music scene, the dance, the candy, and the puppy were all so good and I loved reading every bit of him. Though I dislike the character of Chaol because I couldn't pronounce his name and I found Dorian more likeable. Though I did love how Mass did not make romance the centre of the book because I loved the mystery part.
                Overall this book was very engaging from the trials to Dorian and Celeana's relationship. I loved almost all of it. The negatives was the writing in some portions because it was just a bit boring at parts but overall the good outweighed the bad majorly.

            <h2 class="wordreview">This book was an absolute masterpiece that had my jaw on the floor multiple times. I could not find any flaws because I was so into the story I couldn't think about the writing style or anything else. 
                In the first part of the book Celaena is the king's champion. I enjoyed the plot twist of her not actually killing the targets she was given and I think that was a great way to show her silent defiance and compassion. I did not like how Dorian started distancing himself once he saw Chaol and Celaena relationship developing because I heavily dislike Chaol. The writing of the character was good but I hated how he constantly seemed to forget she was an assassin and him acting shocked every time she killed someone.
                Nehemia's death and betrayal was absolutely insane and I never saw it coming. I never would have guessed that she was secretly part of the rebel movement. I loved the storyline of her urging Celaena to fight back but then before she realises Nehemia sacrificing herself to kick Celaena into a path of revenge. I love how she finally figures out that Chaol sucks and her path of revenge was amazingly written and so engaging. 
                Nehemia's death kicking her into gear and making her realise that she needs to fight back was a bittersweet storyline. I was a bit confused about the wyrdmarks and Dorian being able to use magic but I was still able to follow. 
                Then at the end to wrap it up Mass wrote the most insane plot twist I have ever written when she reveals Celaena Sardothien is the lost princess of Terassan. My mouth was on the floor and I still don't think I have processed this insanely amazing piece of writing.
