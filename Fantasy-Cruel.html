            <h2 class="wordreview">This book series was the first fantasy book series that I read and it was a very good starter. I enjoyed it a lot at the time but I think there are some better book series. I also did find it a bit slow at moments. <br> Jude's childhood was very interesting and quite sad. I found Madoc quite likeable in the first part and it made me forget that he murdered her parents. <br> When we were first introduced to Cardan I could not believe that he was going to be Judes love interest as he seemed to be a bully and very unlikeable however throughout the book I started to really like his character and he evolved quite a bit. <br> I thought the political parts of these books were the most interesting. The world is very well described and very interesting. I found Dain to be quite likeable at the start when he hired Jude as a spy but then as it went on and he forced Jude to stab herself I started hating him. I found Prince Balekin's betrayal very unexpected and sad as the whole royal family was murdered. <br> I hated Taryn as she betrayed Jude and got with Locke. Then she played the victim which was psychopathic and annoying. I was very happy when Jude fought with her as she deserved it. <br> I thought Jude's plan was genius. The way she found out that Oak had royal blood in him and she got Cardan to follow her. I was shocked when she demanded Cardan to stay still and got Oak to crown him. I thought it was a perfectly placed plot twist that was shocking and genius. <br> My favourite part of the whole book was Jude and Cardans relationship. I found myself looking forward to their reactions and loving their scenes together. <br> Overall this book is good for people who don't want too much romance and want more of a political world building fantasy book. </h2>

            <h2 class="wordreview">I thought this book was quite good and a great introduction to fantasy. I liked how it did not focus too much on romance but there was some as well. I liked the politics and the worldbuilding that happened. <br> I liked how it showed Jude's power behind the throne and showed how smart she was. I liked how it showed how strong of a character she was and how she was a complete badass. I liked how she was a mortal and doing so well in a world of fae. <br> I also enjoyed the tension between Jude and Cardan. Their characters are great separately and then even better together. I liked how their interactions were filled with hatred and desire. I feel like their dynamic added another part to the books and made them even more interesting. <br> My favourite part though was the politics and the growing threats to Elfhame. I liked the part about the Undersea and Queen Orlagh partnering with Prince Balekin. I liked their looming war and the decisions made because of the war. <br> I liked when Jude was kidnapped and had to pretend she was being charmed. I thought this part was very smart of Jude and showed her political mind. I also liked seeing Cardan's loyalty and him showing that he also had political experience. <br> Then Taryn is being a menace and pretends to be the victim when she is not. She is marries Locke and continues to get on my nerves. This just proves that Jude is a better person then I'll ever be because Taryn would not be my family anymore. <br> I love Jude and Cardan and they are my favourites. They were so cute together and I love how they were the perfect slow burn enemies to lovers. When Cardan proposed they get married I melted and thought it was so cute. <br> My favourite part of the book is Cardan's betrayal. I never expected that it was going to happen and was very shocked. I thought that Jude would be able to pardon herself because she married Cardan but I guess not because Cardan laughed when she said she was the Queen of Elfhame. <br> The book ended very well and on a bit of a cliffhanger of what she was going to do next. I was very excited to read the next book and could not sleep because I was thinking about it. <br> Overall I think this was a great book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I liked Cardan and Jude a lot as they were great characters and had a great relationship. I think this book was amazing and I recommend this series for anyone who likes fantasy and is okay with not much romance. </h2>

            <h2 class="wordreview">I think this book was a great ending to the Cruel Prince series. I really loved this series and it was a great introduction into fantasy for me and made me realise that it was my favourite genre. I also loved how it did not just focus on the romance but also on the political aspect. <br> I like that during exile Jude was still doing mercenary jobs. I also really liked the scene where she fought Grima Mog. I thought it was very nicely written and showed Jude's strategic mind. <br> I liked the writing of Taryn's plea for help but Jude never should've helped her as Taryn is a menace and does not deserve Jude and her help. I did like that Taryn killed Locke though as Locke is worse than Taryn. I think Jude accepting Taryn's plea shows her character and the loyalty she has for family. <br> I was very happy when Jude returned to Elfhame as she belonged there and was a great leader there. I also loved that Cardan knew she was Taryn and asked her if she got his letters. Side note: read the letters that Cardan sent because they are insanely adorable and you can see him slowly going crazy that Jude wasn't there. <br> I also liked when Jude was kidnapped by Madoc while he thought she was Taryn. I liked the way Oriana helped her escape Madoc because she knew Jude could protect Oak from Madoc's corruption. I also love that Cardan came to help save her as it showed his development from hating her to loving her. <br> I thought the prophecy and the serpent was a very interesting and great storyline. I liked how Cardan realised what the prophecy was about and was willing to sacrifice himself. <br> I loved when Jude stepped up and took control of Elfhame. I feel like she handled that situation wonderfully and that she was so well written. I also liked reading the conflict of what Jude was going to do with Cardan. <br> My favourite part was how Jude knew that Cardan wouldn't want to be controlled by her as a serpent so she made the sacrifice to kill the serpent. I thought this part really showed that she has evolved by going from wanting control and the throne to caring about what Cardan wants and thinks about. When he came out of the serpent I was so happy and I loved this twist. <br> I also loved the final confrontation between Madoc and Jude as it was such a good climax to the novel. She defeats him and proves that she deserves her position as the ruler of Elfhame. <br> I really liked that in the end Jude and Cardan's struggle for power is resolved and they become equals. I thought this was a great ending and I loved Jude and Cardan. <br> Overall I really loved this book series and it was a really good introduction to fantasy for me. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who wants something that is more about politics and fantasy. </h2>
