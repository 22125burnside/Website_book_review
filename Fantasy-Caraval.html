            <h2 class="wordreview">I really liked this book and thought it was very interesting. I loved the character of Scarlett and thought she was an amazing main character. I also loved the plot of the story as it was very interesting and fun to read. <br> I thought the start was very good as it introduced us to the characters, Tella and Scarlett. I liked how it showed us the backstory and how they had been dreaming of going to Caraval forever. I also like how it showed us the sisters' bond and how they look out for each other. <br> I thought that Scarlett was a very selfless person as she was willing to sacrifice herself into a loveless marriage for her sister. I was also so happy when she finally got her invitation to Caraval as she had been sending letters there forever. <br> I really liked Julian and Scarlett's relationship from the start as they were so cute together. Their banter and the ways they would always look out for each other was amazing. <br> I liked the world of Caraval as it was such a fun game to follow and read about and I just wanted to be the one playing it. <br> I also liked that the game's prize was Tella's freedom. I thought this was a great twist and gave Scarlett a lot more motivation which made it more interesting for me to read. <br> I loved all the riddles and clues that were given as it made me motivated to try and solve it even though I couldn't. I also liked the mystery behind Legend's character and the connection he had to her family. <br> I loved how the lines between what was real and what was the game started to blur and how we were constantly reminded that none of it was real. I loved this magical aspect as it was so interesting to read and just gets you caught up in the world. <br> The final part of the game was the most shocking. I was floored when it was revealed that Julian was part of the game and I felt so bad for Scarlett. This made her question her relationship with him and every interaction because everything had been orchestrated by Legend. <br> I was so sad when Tella jumped off the balcony and died as I never expected this to ever happen. BUT THEN it turned out this was all a con against their abusive dad. I was shocked. My mouth was on the floor. I never expected this to happen and I was kind of mad at Tella for putting her sister through that. I do love that the novel ended with Scarlett and Tella reuniting and showing their amazing bond together. I also like how it ended on a cliff hanger and opened up perfectly for the next book.</h2>

            <h2 class="wordreview">This book was not as good as Caraval because I did not like Tella's point of view as much as Scarletts. I did really like the plot and the storyline of this book and found it a lot more magical. <br> I really liked the plot of this book as I found the idea of Tella finding out Legend's name in exchange for her lost mother very interesting. I loved how she got the invitation for another round of Caraval as I really enjoyed reading about Caraval in the last book. <br> I liked how this game had higher stakes and we were able to learn more about this magical world they live in. I thought that Fates was a very interesting concept that was written very well. I also loved the mystery around Legend and the rumours that were going around about him. <br> I really liked the character of Jacks as I found him really charming and had great dialogue. Though I thought the character of Dante was a better fit for Tella as they had a better connection. <br> I liked Tella's role in the game and how she was a key to helping out the fates. I also loved how she was on a mission to find out more about her mother. I liked the destiny cards as well as it expanded on the magical aspect and added even more layers to the book. <br> My favourite part was the mystery in the book with the Fates and with Legend. I also loved the character of Jack's so much throughout the book. <br> I loved the final revelation that Dante was actually Legend. I actually knew this was going to happen because I accidently spoiled myself which was very stupid but it was a good plot twist that I did not expect. <br> I thought that Tella giving up her possible relationship with Dante/Legend and the search for her mother to save the world from the fates showed her character and the development she had throughout the book. <br> I like how it ended by setting up for the book and showing that Tella's story is far from over. <br> Overall I enjoyed this book as I thought the side characters and the plot was really good but I just didn't love that it was in Tella's point of view.</h2>

            <h2 class="wordreview">I really liked this book as it had both Tella and Scarlett's point of view. I thought it was a great ending to the series and I enjoyed it a lot. I loved the magical aspect and the plot was great. <br> I liked the way it showed the aftermath of Caraval and Tella's conflicting feelings. I liked how it showed her feelings for both Dante and Jacks. <br> I was also very intrigued by Scarlett's storyline and the love triangle she had with the Count and Julian. Though I always knew it would be Julian as he is the best. I also liked the revelation of her mother and that she had been a part of the Fates and was the key to taking the other Fates down. <br> I really enjoyed the twist that the Fallen Star (leader of the Fates) was actually Scarlett's father. I had not expected this to happen and it was a really nicely written twist. <br> I thought that Tella's relationship struggles were not that interesting. I didn't hate it but it wasn't my favourite storyline. I thought it was an interesting storyline that Legend really liked Tella but refused to give up his immortality and love her. I thought it was a bit unrealistic that Tella expected that though because he didn't give up immortality to love his brother so why would he give up his immortality to someone he just met. I did love Jacks though as he is amazing and can do no wrong. <br> I liked how Scarlett's story was one of empowerment and self discovery. I thought she had great character development in this book but I do know that it should've been Julian the whole time. <br> I really liked the final battle against the Fates and thought that it was a great climax. I like how it was high stakes and packed with magic. I also liked how Legend sacrificed his immortality for Tella. I do think that it was a bit selfish of Legend to give up his immortality to someone he met not that long ago but would not give up her immortality for his own brother. <br> I do like the ending and how all the loose ends are wrapped up. I also loved how Scarlett chose Julian because he was always the right choice like there was never really another option. I also loved how the book ended with some lingering magic and how that opened up to further books. </h2>
