            <h2 class="wordreview">This book was quite good. I enjoyed the storyline and the dragons but it was a bit boring at times. <br> I liked the character of Violet Sorrengail and her development through the book. It starts with her just wanting to be a scribe but being forced into going into the riders quadrant by her mother. <br> I liked watching the adversities she faced at Basgiath and how she got over them. My favourite is when she poisoned someone to beat them in a fight. It showed her ingenuity and that she deserved to be there. <br> I liked her friendship with Dain and thought that they had a good relationship. Dain wasn't that bad or that good there is not much to talk about. <br> I really liked when she bonded with two dragons and one of them was very powerful. I think this was an interesting part of the plot and definitely kept me very engaged. <br> My favourite part was the development of Xaden and Violet's relationship. I found their banter to be amazing and that they were very cute together. I also started to hate Dain more because he was just kind of annoying. <br> I thought the war and rebellion was a really interesting plot point. None of it was written really well but the ideas were there and great. <br> I liked when Violet found out that Xaden was working for the rebellion and how she had to decide whether she would help the rebellion or defend her country.  <br> Overall I thought this book was quite good and interesting to read. It kept me hooked and I enjoyed the politics quite a lot. It wasn't written the best but the ideas were good so it was fine. </h2>

            <h2 class="wordreview">I thought this book was quite good and I enjoyed the politics. I didn't love how it was written again because I just found it a bit cringey at times and it just wasn't written very well. The ideas made up for it though. <br> I liked the storyline of Violet choosing between her family's legacy and standing up for her country with the rebellion. I also really liked the role of the Venin as I thought they were interesting characters. <br> I liked the time at the war college and how her relationship developed with Xaden. The physical challenges during her time at Basgiath was very interesting to read about but I feel like it just kept talking about how small and fragile she is. I did enjoy reading about her and Xaden's forbidden relationship though. I loved their emotional bond and how much tension there is between them. <br> I liked learning more about the Venin and the history of Navarre. It added so much more to the storyline and was really interesting to read about. <br> I liked watching Violet harness her powers from both Andarna and Tairn. I liked watching her character and power develop throughout the book. <br> I liked the final battle as it was very intriguing and page turning. I enjoyed the sacrifice of Violet's mum and the twists and turns throughout the battle. I was very shocked and confused when Xaden turned venin. I did not like this plot twist as I found it kind of bad and unnecessary. <br> Overall the book was okay and I liked most of it. The ending was not to my liking and the writing style wasn't my favourite but it was okay. </h2>
