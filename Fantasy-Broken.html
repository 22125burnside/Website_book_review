            <h2 class="wordreview">This book was very good and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I like how it continued on with Jack's story and I also really liked Evangeline's character. <br> At the start we were introduced to Evangeline's character very nicely and I already understood that she is a kind hearted character that would do anything for her family. <br> I liked how she started the book sacrificing herself for her sister Marisol even though Marisol was marrying the boy that she loved. I also like the deal that she made with Jacks. <br> I like how we then get taken over to the North with her as we are able to experience a new place and new magic in this world. <br> I really liked the character of Jacks in this book too as I think he is an amazing character with not just charm but also sass. <br> I liked how her relationship develops with Apollo under false pretences because Evangaline had kissed Apollo and when she did it cursed him. I also liked the court side of it and the mystery surrounding it. <br> I like how throughout the story Evangaline is having to confront her idea of love and decide if she really wants her happily ever after that she once wanted so deeply. I also loved how during this time Jack's tested her loyalty while also revealing parts of his true intentions. <br> I liked how in the end she has to decide if she wants to give up on her love story with Apollo and break the curse or keep him under the curse. I enjoyed reading Evangaline's point of view as I like her character a lot. I like how she just wants her true love and is soft and sweet and caring. <br> Overall this book was amazing and I loved it a lot. I loved Jacks and Evangaline they had amazing banter and they were amazing characters. </h2>
