            <h2 class="wordreview">This book was very good and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I like how it continued on with Jack's story and I also really liked Evangeline's character. <br> At the start we were introduced to Evangeline's character very nicely and I already understood that she is a kind hearted character that would do anything for her family. <br> I liked how she started the book sacrificing herself for her sister Marisol even though Marisol was marrying the boy that she loved. I also like the deal that she made with Jacks. <br> I like how we then get taken over to the North with her as we are able to experience a new place and new magic in this world. <br> I really liked the character of Jacks in this book too as I think he is an amazing character with not just charm but also sass. <br> I liked how her relationship develops with Apollo under false pretences because Evangaline had kissed Apollo and when she did it cursed him. I also liked the court side of it and the mystery surrounding it. <br> I like how throughout the story Evangaline is having to confront her idea of love and decide if she really wants her happily ever after that she once wanted so deeply. I also loved how during this time Jack's tested her loyalty while also revealing parts of his true intentions. <br> I liked how in the end she has to decide if she wants to give up on her love story with Apollo and break the curse or keep him under the curse. I enjoyed reading Evangaline's point of view as I like her character a lot. I like how she just wants her true love and is soft and sweet and caring. <br> Overall this book was amazing and I loved it a lot. I loved Jacks and Evangaline they had amazing banter and they were amazing characters. </h2>

            <h2 class="wordreview">I loved this book so much. It was so interesting and I loved the relationship between Evangeline and Jacks. Their banter was amazing and their story line was even better. <br> I liked how it expanded more on the story and there were even more quests for Evangeline and Jacks to solve. I loved the storyline of them finding the Archer's Key together and how we slowly got told what it was about. <br> I liked how the story was filled with magic and action. It was so fun to read and it kept me hooked the whole time. <br> I loved their chemistry and banter throughout the whole story. They were really cute together and I loved every single scene when they were together. Jacks was amazing like always and his witty one liners were so good. <br> I liked how it also expanded on the Fates and told us more about them. I thought this was a really good storyline and I loved learning about all the magical history. <br> I was shocked at the ending when Evangeline opened the gate. I genuinely thought she had died for a second and was gobsmacked. I was also equally as shocked when Jacks gave up his opportunity to go back in time so that he could save Evangeline from being killed. This was such a shocking twist that I never expected and I really enjoyed it. <br> I was then shocked again when Apollo erased Evangeline's memories. It was so heartbreaking and I couldn't believe it. <br> Overall I loved this book and I thought the ending was fantastic. It kept up with the pace of the previous book and was so interesting to read. </h2>

            <h2 class="wordreview">I really liked this book and thought it was a great ending to an amazing story. I loved the storyline and the characters as they were all developed perfectly. <br> I really enjoyed the storyline of Evangeline losing her memories as it was really interesting to read how Apollo manipulated her. <br> I liked Jacks' chapters in this book as I love his character and think he was a very interesting character to read about. <br> I liked the story of Apollo and how he was so unhinged. I was very glad when he got turned into a tree because he was an egotistical ass and deserved it. <br> I really liked the story of Jacks being the Archer as well and the way he called Evangeline,'Little Fox.' I found his character amazing again and loved all their little interactions. I especially loved when he taught Evangeline how to protect herself when she didn't know who he was. They were so cute together and deserved the world. <br> The ending was so good and I really enjoyed it. I liked how it wrapped up the storyline but also left an opening for more stories in the future. I loved how Apollo got what he deserved and that Jacks and Evangeline finally got their happy ending. <br> Overall this book series was amazing and I loved every bit of it. I loved the characters and the plot. It was so interesting to read and watch everything unfold. I loved the character of Evangeline as it was a nice break of all the main characters with a bunch of powers. I liked how she knew what she wanted and what she wanted was love. I also loved Jacks and all his retorts. He was such a good character and I loved reading from his point of view. I also loved Evangeline and Jacks together and in my opinion they are some of the best character's I've ever read about. I recommend this to everyone that wants a magical fantasy romance that is young adult.</h2>
