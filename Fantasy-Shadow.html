            <h2 class="wordreview">I thought this was a good young adult fantasy book but was just a bit boring and drawn out for my liking. <br> I liked the start of this book as it was a very good introduction to the story and I liked how it introduced the world and characters in an easy way to understand. <br> I liked the idea of the shadow fold and Alina being sent through it was very interesting. I liked how it described this world and the problems. I also liked how she was revealed as the sun summoner. I thought that Bardugo went about the reveal in a great way. <br> I liked how we learnt more about the Grisha as it was a good storyline that I enjoyed. I really liked the Darkling character at first and thought that he was a good person but my opinion would soon be changed. <br> I think the way Alina got close to the Darkling and started to develop feelings for him showed how good of a manipulator he is and that he gets what he wants. <br> I liked when she reunited with Mal to find the Morozova Stag as I thought it was cool to learn more about the magical world. <br> The final showdown was my favourite. I was hooked when Mal and Alina were going to kill the stag. I was shocked when the Darkling came and captured them both and I really didn't expect when he bonded the antlers to Alina and used the stag to control her. I thought this plot line was quite interesting to read and I enjoyed it. My favourite part was when Alina broke out because the stag chose her. This was a really good ending and it still opened up to the next book. <br> Overall I think this book was fine. Not the best or the worst. My favourite part was the ending and the rest was good and likeable in the moment but a bit dragged out for me. </h2>

            <h2 class="wordreview">I thought this book was also quite good. It was better and more action packed then the last book but it was not the best book I’ve ever read. <br> I liked the start and how Alina and Mal were together. I love their banter and tension throughout their book and thought they were so cute together. <br> I was shocked that the Darkling found them and was even more powerful. I really liked him as the villain as he was a really well written character. I also liked how Bardugo developed his powers even more as it added more magical layers to it. <br> I really liked the introduction of Sturmhond as he was a really good character. I liked their search for their sea whip. It was a bit boring at times but not too bad. I did however really like the reveal that Sturmhond was really Nikolai Lantsov. I liked how he allied with Alina to build an army against the Darkling. <br> My favourite part is when Alina returns to Ravka and is hailed as a saint as the sun summoner. I thought this was a great plot point and I thought she deserved the title as a symbol of hope. <br> I was also kind of sad for Mal as he felt like he was useless and like he was doing nothing and being isolated as he is not a Grisha. I liked seeing the strain on his and Alina's relationship as it showed that the characters will be able to develop together in the future. <br> I liked reading about the political side of this book. I thought it was quite interesting and I liked reading about her and Nikolai gaining each other's trust and gaining more alliances. <br> I really enjoyed the final battle of the book and the way it was action packed. I was sad when the Darkling prevailed and Alina was left weak after wielding so much of her power but I feel like it left the door open for a really good last book. <br> Overall I really liked the book and thought it was a great follow up. I liked Alina's character and the way she developed through this book. </h2>

            <h2 class="wordreview">I liked this book and I thought it was a very good ending to the series. I think it was very interesting to read about and a very hooking story. <br> The book starts off a little slow as Alina is just biding her time as the Darkling in ravaging Ravka with his shadow army. <br> I enjoyed the history of Morozova and the search for his last amplifier. I thought this gave us more insight into the history of this magical world and found it very interesting. <br> I liked Nikolai's return as I quite liked him as a character but was so devastated when he was captured and turned into the hybrid shadow man. I was glad Alina and everyone else escaped but felt so bad for Nikolai. <br> I really liked the plot twist that Mal was actually the firebird. I feel like this added a lot more purpose to his character and also was so heart wrenching. I also like how Mal accepts this and urges Alina to do what's right for the country. I found this to show that he had developed from the last book when he was feeling useless to finally having a devastating purpose. <br> The final battle was what the whole series had been building up too. I did not like the twist that Alina actually loses her powers. This annoys me because I hate it when the main character loses their powers. I feel like it is such a useless plot twist. I did however enjoy the Darkling begging to be remembered as a good person. <br> I am happy that she is able to fake her death and live a peaceful life without her powers and responsibilities. I thought it was an okay ending but I am glad she is with Mal and Nikolai is leading. <br> Overall I thought this series was a good series and I would recommend it for someone who is starting off in fantasy. I also like how there was an opportunity to develop the story in the future. </h2>
