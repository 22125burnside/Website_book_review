            <h2 class="wordreview"> I really liked this book and the world it is set in. I loved the character of Reed and the order of the Aristene was so good. I thought the story was written quite well and the plot was really interesting. <br> I loved the character of Reed and how she was so determined throughout this whole book. I loved reading about her adventures and I really liked her character <br> I loved Hestion's character and the way he is stubborn and strong-willed like Reed. They complement each other quite well and I enjoyed reading about them. <br> I liked the moral dilemmas that Reed was going through and how she slowly realised that she did not agree with all the Aristene values. <br> I liked seeing the growing bond of Reed and Hestion as they were great together and their scenes were amazing. <br> When we found out that Reed was really bringing Hestion to death I was shocked. I felt so bad for her when it was revealed that every hero she led would die in glory. It was such a betrayal by Aristene and I was so mad for her. <br> I was even more shocked when she gave the sword to Hestion's brother instead of Hestion. I understood why she did it and I understand why Hestion was mad. <br> The ending was very good and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole book. The pacing was a bit slow at times but the plot was quite good. I enjoyed all the twists and betrayals. I recommend this book for anyone who wants a fantasy book that isn't a whole story. </h2>
