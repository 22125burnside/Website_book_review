            <h2 class="wordreview">I loved this book so much it is my favourite series and I would recommend this to everyone. It starts with the main character Rin and her journey to the elite boarding school called Sinegard.
                I loved the start of this book, it was so hooking. I liked the way she escapes an arranged marriage by studying for days on end for a test called the Kenju. I feel like this showed her determination and her badass ways. 
                When she first arrives at Sinegard she is treated like an outsider because of her upbringing and where she was from. This was such an interesting storyline as it made her character develop and showed that she doesn't care about what anyone thinks. 
                I loved the way she is introduced into shamanism and military strategy. I loved the character of Jiang and the way that he taught her how to harness the gods power. I thought it was quite stupid and seemed like an excuse to get high but the more that they talked about it I found it extremely interesting.
                I loved the way she harnesses the Phoenix and the way it fits with her personality. The Phoenix is about rage and destruction and you can see that potential in her. 
                The Third Poppy War beginning was such a good storyline and I thought the political situation with the Nikara Empire was so interesting. 
                I thought that the Sinegard students being conscripted to the army was an amazing decision. I loved how Rin learns more about her Spearly past under the mentorship of Altan Tengsin. I also really liked the way she connected with Nezha during this time. 
                I found Rin and Altan's relationship extremely interesting and complex. I found Altan's self destructive qualities and how his hatred for the Mugenese drives him. 
                As we dive deeper into the story it shows horrific war crimes of the Mugenese. They use chemical weapons and commit mass murder. The attack of Golyn Niis was shocking and Venkas recounts of the attack were absolutely jaw dropping. 
                My favourite part was the development of Altan and Rin's relationship as you can see the way shamanism really drives people crazy. I found it so heartbreaking and shocking when Altan dies as I did not expect a big character to be killed off. Though it was a great choice because it showed Rin's development and the way she fully embraces the Phoenix's rage. 
                The most shocking part is when she wipes out all of the Muganese by burning their entire island to the ground. This was mass genocide and not expected at all. I also found it so interesting to read it from Rin's point of view because of the way she thought she was right. 
                I loved how this book showed Rin's transformation from a lonely orphan to one of the most powerful people in the Nikara Empire.</h2>

            <h2 class="wordreview">This book was insanely good and I could not believe anything that happened. I was so shocked the whole time. I loved the characters and the world and I think that R.F Kuang is an absolute literary genius. 
                I found it so interesting that Altan was still haunting Rin's memory. She felt an immense pressure to live up to his legacy after she killed him and I felt like that was a recipe for disaster. 
                Rin's leadership over Cike was rough and I do not think she was the best as she did not have that much experience and was fuelled with rage. She was being driven with rage and all she wanted was revenge against Emperor Su Daji. 
                I did not expect Yin Nezha to show up again but I was happy about it as I found his previous ending satisfying. I was very glad that Rin had found a place to belong in the Dragon Republic and thought that they would be able to defeat Su Daji together. 
                I really liked the character of Yin Vaisra and thought his vision for the Nikara Empire was going to succeed. He was well equipped and nicely organised and I genuinely thought he would make a great emperor. 
                I liked how Rin was fighting for what she believed in and how she was treated as a central part of the Dragon Republic. I also enjoyed her friendship with Kitay as I think they are platonic soulmates as they were amazing together. 
                I thought the storyline of Rin getting more addicted to opium and the way she is slowly losing control of the Phoenix shows that most Shamans become crazy and helped me understand the downfall of Spear. 
                I was absolutely shocked and destroyed when I found out the Dragon Republic's true colours. I realised that Yin Vaisra was manipulating her and using her as just a weapon the whole time. 
                I loved the debate of morality in Rins point of view and it really made me think. I loved the way it showed true war and the way both sides were committing complete atrocities and the way it was making me think if anyone was truly good. 
                I thought the way Hesparians were introduced gave the story even more dimension and upped the world building to another level. I thought that their history was extremely interesting and the way that they also wanted to use her was really interesting and kind of sad. 
                The climax of the story happens when the civil war's final battle happens. This then results in Rins control over the Phoenix becoming even more fragile. The Dragon Republic ends up winning and they rise even more in power.
                Then in a very shocking and sad turn of events Nezha shows his true colours and stabs Rin in the back. Literally. I had to reread that page over and over again because I genuinely did not believe it. Then to top it off the rest of Cike dies to sacrifice themselves for Rin.
                Then in the most devastating confrontation against Su Daji, Rin learns of her past. I found the Trifecta storyline very interesting and her killing Su Daji only gave me more questions not answers.</h2>
