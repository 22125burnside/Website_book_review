            <h2 class="wordreview">I loved this book so much it is my favourite series and I would recommend this to everyone. It starts with the main character Rin and her journey to the elite boarding school called Sinegard. <br> I loved the start of this book, it was so hooking. I liked the way she escapes an arranged marriage by studying for days on end for a test called the Kenju. I feel like this showed her determination and her badass ways. <br> When she first arrives at Sinegard she is treated like an outsider because of her upbringing and where she was from. This was such an interesting storyline as it made her character develop and showed that she doesn't care about what anyone thinks. <br> I loved the way she is introduced into shamanism and military strategy. I loved the character of Jiang and the way that he taught her how to harness the gods power. I thought it was quite stupid and seemed like an excuse to get high but the more that they talked about it I found it extremely interesting. <br> I loved the way she harnesses the Phoenix and the way it fits with her personality. The Phoenix is about rage and destruction and you can see that potential in her. <br> The Third Poppy War beginning was such a good storyline and I thought the political situation with the Nikara Empire was so interesting. I thought that the Sinegard students being conscripted to the army was an amazing decision. I loved how Rin learns more about her Spearly past under the mentorship of Altan Tengsin. I also really liked the way she connected with Nezha during this time. <br> I found Rin and Altan's relationship extremely interesting and complex. I found Altan's self destructive qualities and how his hatred for the Mugenese drives him. <br> As we dive deeper into the story it shows horrific war crimes of the Mugenese. They use chemical weapons and commit mass murder. The attack of Golyn Niis was shocking and Venkas recounts of the attack were absolutely jaw dropping. <br> My favourite part was the development of Altan and Rin's relationship as you can see the way shamanism really drives people crazy. I found it so heartbreaking and shocking when Altan dies as I did not expect a big character to be killed off. Though it was a great choice because it showed Rin's development and the way she fully embraces the Phoenix's rage. <br> The most shocking part is when she wipes out all of the Muganese by burning their entire island to the ground. This was mass genocide and not expected at all. I also found it so interesting to read it from Rin's point of view because of the way she thought she was right. <br> Overall I loved how this book showed Rin's transformation from a lonely orphan to one of the most powerful people in the Nikara Empire.</h2>

            <h2 class="wordreview">This book was insanely good and I could not believe anything that happened. I was so shocked the whole time. I loved the characters and the world and I think that R.F Kuang is an absolute literary genius. <br> I found it so interesting that Altan was still haunting Rin's memory. She felt an immense pressure to live up to his legacy after she killed him and I felt like that was a recipe for disaster. <br> Rin's leadership over Cike was rough and I do not think she was the best as she did not have that much experience and was fuelled with rage. She was being driven with rage and all she wanted was revenge against Emperor Su Daji. <br> I did not expect Yin Nezha to show up again but I was happy about it as I found his previous ending satisfying. I was very glad that Rin had found a place to belong in the Dragon Republic and thought that they would be able to defeat Su Daji together. <br> I really liked the character of Yin Vaisra and thought his vision for the Nikara Empire was going to succeed. He was well equipped and nicely organised and I genuinely thought he would make a great emperor. <br> I liked how Rin was fighting for what she believed in and how she was treated as a central part of the Dragon Republic. I also enjoyed her friendship with Kitay as I think they are platonic soulmates as they were amazing together. <br> I thought the storyline of Rin getting more addicted to opium and the way she is slowly losing control of the Phoenix shows that most Shamans become crazy and helped me understand the downfall of Spear. <br> I was absolutely shocked and destroyed when I found out the Dragon Republic's true colours. I realised that Yin Vaisra was manipulating her and using her as just a weapon the whole time. I loved the debate of morality in Rins point of view and it really made me think. I loved the way it showed true war and the way both sides were committing complete atrocities and the way it was making me think if anyone was truly good. I thought the way Hesparians were introduced gave the story even more dimension and upped the world building to another level. I thought that their history was extremely interesting and the way that they also wanted to use her was really interesting and kind of sad. <br> The climax of the story happens when the civil war's final battle happens. This then results in Rins control over the Phoenix becoming even more fragile. The Dragon Republic ends up winning and they rise even more in power.Then in a very shocking and sad turn of events Nezha shows his true colours and stabs Rin in the back. Literally. I had to reread that page over and over again because I genuinely did not believe it. Then to top it off the rest of Cike dies to sacrifice themselves for Rin.<br> Then in the most devastating confrontation against Su Daji, Rin learns of her past. I found the Trifecta storyline very interesting and her killing Su Daji only gave me more questions not answers.</h2>

            <h2 class="wordreview">This book is one of my favourite books that I have ever read and I will never stop recommending it. It has so many twists and turns that you would never expect and all the characters are so well written.  <br> I found the aftermath of the last book very interesting as she became very dependent on the Phoenix and Opium. I found her internal battle interesting to read and thought it was perfectly written. <br> My favourite part was reading about how consumed in anger she was and the way she only wanted revenge. I found her a very complex character that was very interesting to analyse. I found a lot of parallels between her and Altan and it showed the way most Spearly's descended into madness because of their connection with the Phoenix and their dependence on Opium. <br> I loved the role of the Trifecta and Su Daji as I found their history and dynamic very interesting. I found their end not that satisfying and kind of sad but it fit their characters. I like how Daji showed Rin the true intentions of the Hesparians and how she protected Nikara from them. I liked how this created a new layer of conflict as she was not only fighting to take back her country but fighting to stop it from being colonised. <br> My second favourite part was Nezha and Rin's conflict. I found it heart wrenching and so interesting. I loved the connection between Nezha and the Dragon Lord as it showed that he understood where she was coming from. <br> I loved reading Rin and Kitay's friendship and how they were bonded together through the Phoenix. I also found it absolutely heartbreaking Kitay knew he was going to die when Rin sacrificed herself and still supported it. Throughout this whole book Kitay and Rin were such good characters and their friendship evolved throughout the books. <br> I also like how Kuang showed her descending madness by making her alienate her allies and even accuse her friend Venka. I found that part extremely interesting as Venka had supported her throughout the whole civil war and when things started to go wrong Rin got so paranoid that she ended up blaming Venka for Nezha's notes. I really liked how Venka then died for Rin the moment after making her life end before knowing if she ever betrayed Rin. <br> The climax in the book is when Nezha and Rin have their final showdown and this was the best ending written ever. The way Rin realises that she needed to die for her country. Kitay knew he was going to die as well as Rin but still understood her decision. Then worst of all the way Nezha was then left behind holding her body and knowing that he's going to be alone. I really liked the theory that Rin is going to haunt him like Altan haunted Rin. I also like the theory that he doesn't die but ends up like Su Daji. <br> Overall this book series is the best I have and will ever read. The parallels between Altan and Rin, Rin's descent into madness, All the plot twists, and all the themes were so interesting and engaging. I loved the theme of history repeating itself with the Trifecta and then Nezha, Rin, and Kitay. Rin is my favourite character ever written and the world is so interesting. In conclusion, everyone should read the book at least once.</h2>
