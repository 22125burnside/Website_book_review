            <h2 class="wordreview">This was a very good book that was really hooked and fun to read. I enjoyed the main character as she is very head strong and able to defend herself. I also really liked how there was a lot of romance in this book as well as action. <br> I really liked the character of Paedyn. I thought she was a great main character and very interesting to read about. I enjoyed her friendship with Adena and the way they would do anything for eachother. I also loved the fact that even though she was powerless in a world of people with powers that she was able to overcome and overcome any obstacles. <br> I loved the trials part of the story as it was very interesting to watch her go through them. I immensely enjoyed her relationship with Kai throughout it and their banter was top tier. <br> My favourite part was Paedyn joining the revolution. I thought this was a great part of the storyline and helped add more depth to the story. I really liked the way she stands up for what she believes in as well. <br> My favourite part was Kai and Paedyn's relationship. I found it so adorable and their banter was top tier. When they were in the first trial together I was in love with them. <br> I thought the ending was amazing. I loved the plot twist of Adena dying as it was so unexpected and out of the blue. I also loved how the resistance fought back after this. I loved how Paedyn got her revenge and killed the King. I also thought it was an amazing twist that Kai found her after she'd killed the king and gave her the opportunity to run. This was an amazing ending and led into the next book perfectly. <br> Overall I really liked the mix of romance and action in this book. I would recommend this for someone who wants an action packed book with betrayals and romance. </h2>

            <h2 class="wordreview">This book was an amazing novell and it is one of my favourite reads and had me sobbing violently at the end. I loved how we saw more about Adena and how she was able to experience love before she died. <br> I loved the character of Adena in this book as I found her so likeable and adorable. <br> I liked how she would do anything for Paedyn and it gave more depth to their friendship. <br> I also really enjoyed the romance between Adena and Mak. I think they were really cute together and they deserved a better ending. I found their relationship to develop amazingly throughout the book. I loved how Roberts didn't dive straight into it but developed their characters and stories more. <br> The last part was heartbreaking. The way they only just got together and he was waiting there for her. When it was her point of view after she was taken it was so sad. When she started talking about how they broke her sewing fingers I sobbed. I felt so bad when she started talking to that person in prison and he realised that she really didn't deserve to be there. I sobbed so hard when Mak was waiting in the fort for Adena and he had a present for her. He was waiting for her for so long and didn't know that she was about to die. What broke my heart even more was when he went to watch the trials with her but ended up watching her die. When he started talking about being in the stars I sobbed. I am crying writing this review right now. <br> Overall this was the most heartbreaking book I've ever read. I don't think I cried harder than when I was reading this book. On a positive note I enjoyed the way it also developed Paedyn's character as it showed their deep connection and how she will get her revenge. </h2>

            <h2 class="wordreview">I thought this book was quite good on the romance and drama front but the plot was not progressing that much. I liked Paedyn and Kai's interactions and they should've just stayed in the flower field. <br> In this book I found that there wasn't much about the plot happening. The only things we learned is that Kai and Kitt had a sister who died and that Kitt is now ruling with this other guy who used to be in the resistance by his side. I think this book was more about romance and vibes and I purely rated it four stars for that. <br> I found Paedyn's character to be fine in this book. She didn't seem to have any character development or get any of her revenge but hopefully that will happen in the next book. I was a bit mad that they didn't touch that much on Adena's death and I think that it would've been better if Adenea's death helped develop and influence Paedyn's character. I did like how she was still part of the resistance though. <br> I thought Kai was just a pretty face with some good dialogue in this book and that is not a bad thing if that's what you are looking for. Personally I liked it because I like cute flirty banter and romance but if you want more politics and fantasy then this book is not for you. <br> I really liked Kai and Paedyn's relationship and I think that it was the main focus of this book and I do wish Roberts developed the plot a little bit more but it was not bad. <br> I thought that the plot twist when Kitt announced his and Paedyn's marriage was a little bit expected. I did get spoiled before I read it but when I was spoiled I was more surprised she used that storyline because people had already guessed it. <br> Overall I think if you are looking for banter and a romance that has formed against all odds then this is for you. I personally enjoyed it since I was in the mood for it and it is the type of thing I like but I understand why people didn't like it as much. </h2>
